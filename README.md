# Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gennaro Di Fiandra and <br>I am a WordPress Developer.

I am a WordPress Developer with 13 years of experience, proficient in HTML, CSS (including SCSS and Bootstrap), JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

I have expertise in developing themes, plugins, and blocks. My experience extends to WordPress and WooCommerce APIs, integrating custom fields libraries, using Gutenberg and most popular page builders, and connecting WordPress with external applications through their APIs.

My workflow tools include Devilbox (Docker), ZSH, WP-CLI, NPM, Gulp, Composer, Visual Studio Code, Nano, GIT, GitHub, Chrome, Postman, and Markdown. Additionally, I am proficient in using tools like Figma, Affinity Designer, Photoshop, and Adobe XD to extract CSS values from existing designs.

My knowledge goes beyond development and covers Marketing (brand positioning, copywriting, advertising, SEO) and UX design, which I have successfully applied to my own business in the past.

In 2023, I have expanded my skills learning React (React 18, React Router 6, Zustand, TypeScript, Vite), and now I am able to complete low-complexity tasks in existing applications and understanding WordPress blocks development.

Additionally, I am proficient with the Google suite (Search Engine, YouTube, Maps, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Gmail), Notion, various AI tools, and Camtasia Studio.

My English language skills are at a B level in reading and writing, while I am less proficient in direct conversation. I am currently studying English to improve these skills.
