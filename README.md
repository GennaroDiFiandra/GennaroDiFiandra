# Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gennaro Di Fiandra and <br>I am a WordPress Developer.

I am a WordPress Developer with 13 years of experience. I develop all over the stack: HTML, CSS (plus SCSS and Bootstrap), Javascript, PHP, SQL. I am able to develop themes, plugins and blocks (both in React and PHP).

I have experience over the most core APIs and WooCommerce; with the integration of Carbon Fields and Advanced Custom Fields; with the use of Gutenberg and most popular page builders.

I use a set of tools in my workflow: Devilbox (Docker), ZSH, WP-CLI, npm, gulp, composer, Visual Studio Code, Nano, GIT, GitHub, Chrome, Postman, Markdown.

During freelancing, I have learned about marketing (brand positioning, copywriting, advertising, SEO) and UX design and I applied this knowledge to my business.

In 2023, I have learned about React (stack React 18, React Router 6, Zustand, Typescript, Vite) and now I am able to complete low complexity tasks on existent applications and develop WordPress blocks.

I am able to use Figma, Affinity Designer, Photoshop, Adobe XD to get values for CSS and Camtasia Studio to produce video tutorials.

Moreover, I am proficient with the Google suite (Search Engine, YouTube, Maps, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides Calendar, Gmail), Notion and some AIs.

I have a good level of reading and writing in the English language, while I am less proficient in conversation, especially in the listening part (I am working to improve).

In addition to my professional role as a web developer, I manage all aspects of independent living. This experience is constantly enhancing my organizational skills.

Besides, I enjoy playing with my granddaughter, learning new things, running, cooking, watching a soccer game, a movie or a TV series.

The topics I am most interested in and I learn about are health, wealth, productivity
