# Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gennaro Di Fiandra and <br>I am a WordPress Developer.

I am a WordPress Developer with 13 years of experience, proficient in HTML, CSS (including SCSS and Bootstrap), JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

I have expertise in developing themes, plugins, and blocks (using both React and PHP). My experience extends to core WordPress APIs and WooCommerce, integrating custom fields libraries, and working with Gutenberg and other popular page builders.

My workflow tools include Devilbox (Docker), ZSH, WP-CLI, NPM, Gulp, Composer, Visual Studio Code, Nano, GIT, GitHub, Chrome, Postman, and Markdown. Additionally, I am proficient in using tools like Figma, Affinity Designer, Photoshop, and Adobe XD to extract CSS values from existing designs.

My knowledge goes beyond development and covers Marketing (brand positioning, copywriting, advertising, SEO) and UX design, which I have successfully applied to my own business.

In 2023, I expanded my skills learning React (React 18, React Router 6, Zustand, TypeScript, Vite), and I am now capable of completing low-complexity tasks in existing applications and developing WordPress blocks.

Additionally, I am proficient with the Google suite (Search Engine, YouTube, Maps, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Gmail), Notion, various AI tools, and Camtasia Studio.

My English language skills are intermediate in reading and writing, though I am less proficient in direct conversation. I am currently studying English with a certified tutor to improve these skills.
