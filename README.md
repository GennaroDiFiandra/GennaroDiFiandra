# Hello üëã, my name is Gennaro Di Fiandra and <br>I am a WordPress + React Developer.

I am a Web Developer with 14 years of full-remote experience (11 as a freelancer and 3 as an employee).

‚û°Ô∏è I started in 2011 by studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developing static websites.
‚û°Ô∏è In 2012, I began studying WordPress, creating corporate and eCommerce websites.
‚û°Ô∏è Later, I studied PHP, developing themes and plugins for WordPress.
‚û°Ô∏è I focused on WordPress and its related technologies for 13 years.
‚û°Ô∏è In 2024, I started learning React while working on two company web apps.

In WordPress-based development, I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP. I have also studied relational database design and SQL but have not accumulated significant experience in this area.

Regarding WordPress specifically, I have developed themes and plugins, gaining expertise in WordPress and WooCommerce APIs, integrating WordPress with external platforms via APIs, working with custom field libraries, Gutenberg, and the most popular page builders.

Regarding React, I have studied and gained experience with the TypeScript, React, React Router, xState, and Tailwind stack. I am continuing to study to expand my knowledge in this field while working on a company web app.

During my freelance years, I studied marketing (brand positioning, copywriting, advertising, SEO), UX, and UI design, applying this knowledge to my business.

My current web development workflow includes ZSH, Node, NPM, Devilbox (Docker), Gulp, Vite, Composer, WP-CLI, Visual Studio Code, GIT, GitHub, Chrome, Bruno, and Markdown.

Additionally, I can use tools like Figma, Affinity Designer, Photoshop, and Adobe XD to extract CSS values, and I am proficient with Google Suite (Search, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Gmail), Notion, ChatGPT, and Camtasia Studio.

My English proficiency is intermediate in reading and writing, while I am less skilled in direct conversation.
